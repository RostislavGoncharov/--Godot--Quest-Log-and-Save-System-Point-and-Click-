# A Simple Quest Log System made in Godot/GDScript
This is a prototype of a quest log & save system for a point & click adventure game.
In this prototype, you can navigate among several sample screens and collect journal entries by finding and clicking a certain area on the screen.
You can view your collected journal entries by clicking the Journal button.
Journal entries are split into categories (Cycle 1, Cycle 2 and Misc). This helps to keep the entries organized. Each entry has a category assigned to it through code.
The button in the top left corner of the screen navigates to the next screen (it's supposed to be turned into a set of "go forward/back/left/right" buttons later, so it's just a placeholder for now). The navigation button is not always active.
Press the Save and Exit button to save and exit :)
After that, you can press Load Game to load all the journal entries you've collected.
There's only one save slot in the system.
